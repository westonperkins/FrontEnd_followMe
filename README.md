## User Stories
- The user can login or register with a new account
- The user will be able to create a posts 
- The user will be able to read through a feed with other people's posts
- The user can read, update, and delete their posts
- The user can search through other users profiles

## Major Hurdles
 1. Getting CRUD Frontend routes to communicate with the Backend CRUD routes
 2. Working with Git Workflow


## Ideas for Future Modifications
1. Allow user to upload more than text for their Posts. For example:
    - Image Upload
    - Gifs
2. Allow users to upload profile picture
3. Add ability to like and share certain activities
4. Add ability for user to "follow" other users
5. Improve UX/UI Elements and Usability Testing. For example:
    - Logout not in Nav Bar
    - Error message before deleting post
